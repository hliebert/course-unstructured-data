1. Introduction
In many applications of duration analysis, structural interpretations can be given to defects in duration distributions. In studies of fecundity, defects in durations until first birth correspond to sterility (e.g., Heckman and Walker, 1990). Defects in unemployment duration distributions are sometimes associated with structural unemployment (e.g., Ridder and van den Berg, 1998). In the job matching model by Jovanovic (1979), some workers and firms learn rapidly that their matches are of exceptional value and should be cherished, and job tenure distributions are defective. In medicine, some proportion of a population under study may not be susceptible to developing a disease (e.g., Hougaard et al., 1994).
An early and well-known model of defective duration distributions is the mover­stayer model by Blumen et al. (1955). They assume that a population of job holders consists of a group of `stayers', who never leave their jobs, and a group of `movers', who leave their jobs at constant rates. The resulting job duration distribution of the population has a defect equal to the share of the stayers in the population. In the duration-to-birth example, stayers can be identified with sterile couples, and movers

with fertile couples. However, not all fertile couples necessarily have children. This suggests an extension of the mover­stayer model with an additional group, `defecting movers' (e.g., Go¨nu¨l, 1989). Unlike stayers, defecting movers have typically been at risk of moving, but have eventually ended up never moving. Such a group exists if the hazard rates of moving decrease sufficiently fast with duration, for instance exponentially.
If mover hazards vary with regressors, the share of defecting movers typically varies with the regressors as well, and is generally lower for groups with high hazards. For example, if socioeconomic circumstances increase the rate at which couples reproduce, they are less likely to grow old without having at least one child. Alternatively, defects could vary with regressors through the share of stayers (Heckman and Walker, 1987).
In this note, we discuss identification of potentially defective duration models. Even though such models have been estimated in various special and parametric forms, non-parametric identification has hardly been discussed in the literature. Section 2 introduces a mixed proportional hazard (MPH) duration model with stayers and defective movers. We first assume that the share of stayers is independent of the regressors, and show that we only need data for two samples corresponding to two values of the regressors for identification. Existing identification proofs for the two-sample case routinely assume defectiveness away (Elbers and Ridder, 1982; Kortram et al., 1995). Section 3 qualifies this result by discussing models in which the share of stayers depends on the regressors.

2. An identification theorem

Consider the following MPH model for a random variable T $ 0 conditional on a k 3 1-vector of regressors X (e.g., Lancaster, 1979):

E Pr(T . tuX) 5 +(z(t)f(X)): 5 e2z(t)f(X )vdG(v),

(1)

with f:- , Rk  (0, `), z:[0, `)  [0, `) continuously differentiable with z9 . 0 and z(0) 5 0, G the distribution of some nonnegative random variable V independent of X, and + its Laplace transform.1 Eq. (1) is a mixture of the distribution of T u(X, V ) over the distribution G of V. The hazard rate corresponding to the distribution of T u(X, V ) is z9(t)f(X)V, which explains the name `mixed proportional hazard'.
Suppose that X assumes only two values, say x1 and x2. Denote the corresponding survival functions by F¯1(t): 5 Pr(T . tuX 5 x1) and F¯2(t): 5 Pr(T . tuX 5 x2), and the cumulative distribution functions by F1: 5 1 2 F¯1 and F2: 5 1 2 F¯2. We have that limt` F¯i(t) 5 limt` +(f(xi )z(t)) . 0 if either limt` z(t) , ` or limz` +(z) 5 Pr(V 5 0) . 0, or both. Obviously, Pr(V 5 0) is the share of stayers. Limt` F¯i(t) includes both stayers and defecting movers, and is smallest for that i such that f(xi ) is largest. We have the following non-parametric identification result.
Proposition 1. If E[V ] 5 1, f(x1) 5 1, and c: 5 f(x2) ± 1, there corresponds a unique triple (z, c, + ) to each pair (F¯1,¯F2) consistent with Eq. (1).

1The assumptions that z is continuously differentiable and that z9 . 0 are made for expositional convenience only, and can be relaxed. Also, we could allow for `observed' stayers, i.e. f(x) 5 0 for some x, but this would be trivial.

Proof. The proof closely follows Kortram et al. (1995). First, l'Ho^spital's rule gives c 5 limt0 F2(t) /F1(t). Suppose that c . 1 (the case c , 1 is similar). We have that, for any t [ [0, `), y: 5 F¯2(t) 5 +(cz(t))z(t) 5 c21+ 21( y). Also, t 5 F¯ 221( y), so that

By induction, it follows that, for y [ (]l, 1], with ]l: 5 limt` F¯2(t),

,

and

the

Now, l'Ho^spital's rule gives

This + 21

extended uniquely to [0, `). h

The conditions in the Proposition are standard in the MPH literature (e.g., Elbers and Ridder, 1982).

The normalizations are innocuous, apart from requiring that E[V ] , `. Unlike Kortram et al. (1995), we have to keep track of the intervals on which + 21 and + are identified, and exploit the real

analyticity of + to extend identification to [0, `).

The result can be partially extended to censored data by applying the identification theorem for

interval-censored

to

identify + from interval-censored data, again routinely assuming defectiveness away. We could

extend our result along these lines and identify the share of stayers from interval-censored data.

However, with right-censoring, and therefore interval-censoring, the share of defecting movers is not

identified.

3. Some extensions and qualifications
The result in Section 2 breaks down if we extend the model by allowing the share of stayers to depend on the regressors. To investigate this case, denote the share of stayers for a given vector of regressors x by q:x [ - Pr(V 5 0uX 5 x) [ [0, 1). Assume that the unobservable V is independent of X among movers, i.e. V *Xu(V . 0). Now, even though V will in general depend on X unconditionally, the specific structure of this dependence facilitates identification. We give two conditions that ensure identification by somehow identifying non-defecting movers.
First, we could assume that none of the movers defect, i.e. that limt` z(t) 5 `, which gives a model similar to that in Heckman and Walker (1987). Then, for each x [ -, the share of stayers q(x) is immediately identified as the defect in the observed conditional duration distribution. This can be used to correct our data and model for defects, as in

+~ (z(t)f(x)),

where +~ is the Laplace transform of the distribution of V u(V . 0). As +~ is independent of x by
assumption, the results in e.g. Kortram et al. (1995), or just Proposition 1, can be applied to prove
identification of the corrected model in the two-sample case.
Alternatively, we could assume that the regressors can be varied to single out a limiting group of
non-defecting movers, without varying the share of stayers. More formally, suppose that - 5 -0 3 -q, with -0 , Rl and -q , Rk2l, and that q((x0, xq)) 5 q~(xq ) for all x0 [ -0 and xq [ -q, for some q~ :-q  [0, 1). In other words, the first l regressors are excluded from the share of stayers, but may affect the mover hazards. Furthermore, for any given xq [ -q, a sequence hn [ -0 exists such that limn` f((hn, xq)) 5 `. This `large support' assumption ensures that a limiting group of non-defecting movers exists within each group characterized by the last k 2 l regressors. Then, for each xq [ -q, we can identify q~(xq) as the defect in the conditional duration distribution for this limiting group. The model of Section 2 can be considered a special case where all regressors are excluded from q. It
should be noted that the large support assumption of Heckman and Singer (1984), requiring f to
assume all values in (0, `), trivially yields identification in this model, as in our second case above.
However, Proposition 1 shows that we do not need such a large support assumption in this special
case, but only data for two samples corresponding to different values of the regressor effect f.
